FizzBuzz is a kid's word game turned into a common coding interview question.
<br>
It involves creating code to count numbers while replacing some numbers with words.

Details of FizzBuzz:<br>
Create logic using java to count from 1 to 100. However, for
numbers divisible by three (3), the code will return the word "Buzz";
numbers divisible by five (5), the code will return the word "Fizz"; 
and numbers divisible by both three and five, the word "FizzBuzz" will display.
