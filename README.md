# ClassicFizzBuzz
FizzBuzz is a kid's word game turned into a common coding interview question.
<br>
It involves creating code to count numbers while replacing some numbers with words.

Details of this ClassicFizzBuzz repo:<br>
The logic was created using java to count from 1 to 100. <br>
For numbers divisible by three (3), the code will return the word "Fizz";
numbers divisible by five (5), the code will return the word "Buzz"; 
and numbers divisible by both three and five, the word "FizzBuzz" will display.
